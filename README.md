# AutoInventory

## Introduction

I work at a Pizza Hut where, every week and at the end of every month, we count inventory.
The process went a little something like this:

1. Count items and write them down on paper
2. Enter the numbers into an Excel spreadsheet
3. Print out the Excel spreadsheet
4. Enter the numbers into eResturant that will be sent to corporate, which involved:
    1. Enter the item ID in the search bar
    2. Enter the item count in the correct box
    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all ~70 items (or more for other stores)

I noticed this extremely tedious process my manager would have to endure every week, and that she was quite a few weeks behind on it.
I found it a little crude that you had to enter the same numbers into the computer twice in two seperate places,
so I created this script that would automate step 4, making step 3 obsolete.
Now the process is like this:

1. Count items and write them down on paper
2. Enter the numbers into an Excel spreadsheet
3. Run AutoInventory and watch the magic happen!
